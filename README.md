Netflix Customer Churn

Netflix Customer Churn Analysis 📊
Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing customer churn in Netflix subscriptions using Python and data science techniques.
The objective is to understand customer behaviour, identify key drivers of churn, and generate insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook and includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualisation.

Dataset

The dataset (netflix_customer_churn.csv) contains customer-level information related to Netflix subscriptions, such as:

Customer demographics

Subscription details

Usage behaviour

Churn status (whether the customer has cancelled the service)

Note: The dataset is used purely for analytical and educational purposes.

Key Objectives

Understand the distribution of churned vs non-churned customers

Identify patterns and trends linked to customer churn

Explore relationships between customer attributes and churn behaviour

Present insights using clear visualisations

Tools & Technologies

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualisation
