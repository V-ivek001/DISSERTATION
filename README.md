# Netflix Customer Churn Analysis
## Project Description

This project analyses customer churn in Netflix subscriptions using Python and data science techniques.
The goal is to identify behavioural and demographic factors that influence customer cancellations and to generate insights that support customer retention strategies.

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and supported with visualisations and exploratory data analysis.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is netflix_customer_churn.csv, which contains customer-level data including:

* Customer demographics
* Subscription details
* Usage behaviour
* Churn status (active or cancelled subscription)
* This dataset is used for educational and analytical purposes only.

## Objectives

* Analyse the distribution of churned and retained customers
* Identify key factors associated with customer churn
* Explore relationships between customer attributes and churn
* Visualise insights using clear and informative charts

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas – data processing and manipulation
* NumPy – numerical computation
* Matplotlib – data visualisation
* Seaborn – statistical visualisation

## How to Run the Project
### Option 1: Run the Notebook

### Option 2: View Without Running Code
Open Vivek.html in any web browser to view the complete analysis and visualisations.

## Key Insights

* The analysis provides insights into:
* Patterns differentiating churned and retained customers
* Subscription and usage behaviours linked to churn
* Data-driven observations that can inform retention strategies
* Detailed explanations and charts are included within the notebook.

## Future Enhancements
